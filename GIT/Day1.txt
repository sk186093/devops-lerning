DevOps :::: strategy / process ---> to achieve Continuous Improvement. 

Continuous Interaction!

IT ::

SDLC ???

Requirement Analysis  ------- > Prod Delivery

Requirement Analysis
Design
Development / Code 
Test
Deployment

Main... 

Waterfall Model ::: Linear Approach.

Monolith Application.

Agile Methodology...

Iteration1,2,3,4,5 




#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

water-fall model ---> Agile ---> DevOps ---> DevSecOps ---> SRE ---> gitOps ---> AIOps

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Continuous Deployment****


DevOps :::

Applications  ... 


Telecom ::: 

Telecom service providers...

sp1 -- Introduce new service/plan ...

sp2 -- 


Teams involved in SDLC :::

Infra-Structure Team
Development Team
Testing
Release Management Team 
Security Team
Monitoring Team
Support Team

Continuous Development ::: IDE's -- Visual Studio Code, Eclipse based IDE's - GUI Based code development tool.

C/Integration. --> build and create artifacts.(binaries) *.war / *.jar

C/Delivery -- > promoted to next test environments. continuous Testing!

C/Deployment --> Promoted to Production environment.


Various Environments ::: 

Non-Prod Environment:

	Developement Environment --- IDE's -- Visual Studio Code, Eclipse based IDE's - GUI Based code development tool.
	Build Environment  --- Build tools .. build and create artifacts.(binaries) *.war / *.jar
	Testing Environment --- promoted to next test environments. continuous Testing!
		QA ---> UAT ---> Pre-Prod/Staging

Prod Environment:
	Production Environment



Complete DevOps CI/Cd/CD


Code --> Commited in a src code repository
pick up the code
perform build
create artifacts
delivery / deploy


Use Cases :::
 
Sign-up -- 
Sign-in
search for req. items.
check the reviews
adding the items to cart
place my order
payment
order is confirmed
track...


Monolith Approach 
(vs)
Micro-services 

dev1 -- sign-up service --> 	code/Unit-testing/ & Continuously integrate for further testing(QA)
								/C-delivery/C-deployment 
dev2 -- sign-in service -->		code/Unit-testing/ & Continuously integrate for further testing(QA)
								/C-delivery/C-deployment 



dev1 -- CR - sign-up service --> 	code	
									intergate the code for Unit-testing (to next envi.) DEV Envi
									integrate for further testing(QA)
									/C-delivery/C-deployment 

C-I

C-Delivery


Non-Prod					Prod

DEV ---> QA ---> UAT  (Security Audit) ---> 	Prod 


C-Delivery -- need manual approval for prod. deployment

C-Deployment -- It is completely Automated from Dev to PROD

Banking Domain ::: 

periodic sms notifications 
Create Deployment Windows -- 4hrs - during non-business hours
 
facebook/netflix/google/amazon.... 




People !!!! are the very big Issue in Implementing DevOps.
Process
Tools


ALM Tool -- Appln. LifeCycle Management Tool -- Jira 

Development --- Visual Studio Code, Eclipse based IDE 
Source Code --- GIT (VCS)
CI/CD --- Jenkins, gitlab-ci, bamboo
Testing --- selenium, junit
Deployment --- Docker/Kubernetes / Ansible
monitoring --- Nagios, prometheus , Grafana


Now What Next ?????

Environment

Create AWS Free - tier Account...

& Create Linux Virtual Machines 

email-id, phone number , active debit/credit card. 


#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``

Version Control System ::: 

Developer -- create a Java Program

VS Code -- create a Java Program eg. hello.java -- index.jsp -  jdk 1.8  --> 1.7

should be tracked and version controlled. 

index.jsp ==> saved v1.0 ---> Integrated to QA 
index.jsp ==> saved v1.1 ---> Integrated to QA 
index.jsp ==> saved v1.2 ---> Integrated to QA 
index.jsp ==> saved v1.3 ---> Integrated to QA  -- to prod 
index.jsp ==> saved v1.4 ---> Integrated to QA 


Version control System --- > GIT

Sharing the source codes to global users or with the team. 

Freelancer - web developer  +3
Local VCS 
Using Remote/Global VCS 


index.jsp -- added 5 lines of code --- saved --- v1.0

index.jsp -- added 5 more lines of code --- saved --- v1.1



GIT ::: 

How to install --- >

GIT Workflow: 
GIT Branching Strategies:



Summary::

workflow :
20 files 
local repository				-- working Dir ==> Staging Area ==> Local repo

remote repository
	
git add 
git commit		jus commit into my local repo

git clone				10 files ++1 
git pull						
git fetch
git push 

git checkout / Merge

DEV-A
Local Repo 
Project1 Folder ::::

src code & the project related config files 



DEV-B
Local Repo 
Project2 Folder ::::

src code & the project related config files 


pushed dev-b src to remote repo 

git fetch ----- update the local repo -- & pick only the required changes to project folder/WS

git pull  ----- update the local repo as well as project folder/WS
==fetch + merge 

DEV : A B 

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

remote repo::

github --

gitlab
bitbucket
azure repo 
aws commit
